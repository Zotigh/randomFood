# FoodRandomizer1

## generate a random food plate


* Random Food
 * The basic functionality will be to randomize food based on categorys such as the main meat used, and the sides.
 things like the persons dietary limitations can be changed on a settings window.maybe could implement caloric intake per plate so a calculation would be needed
 * I feel that the people that would be intersted are those people that have no clue as to what to have for a meal. I often have this problem and think it would be nice to have something like this.
 ** User Stories
 	 
 	  AS A/AN...  I WANT TO...														      SO THAT...
 	+ As a (User) I want to (Have a system that can take what I like and make a random decision) so that (I dont have to decide what to make for a meal.) 
 	+ As a (User) I want to (Be able to have something that will Conture to my dietary restrictions) so that (I dont have to worry.)
 * This app could be used with out a internet connection as it takes choices the user puts in and randomizes it based on the user imput and preferences
 * At the moment I cannot think of a simple way to make this connected to the internet and use a data base as it would mainly rely on the individual. Something might become aparent after further development.
