# SQL tabel
## I need a data base of recipes. The data base I beleive will contain rows of information on various things like key ingredients, and cook time. 
I also think that if there are any linked lists it might be on place of origin. A cook that made the recipe, or maybe even links to other recipes 
on alternative dishes that might not contain ingredients undesired by the user. All in all I beleive that my app will at first focused on the 
ingredient aspect of the data base for now.
